# Stroke-Prediction
**Project 4(Final Project)** <br/>
Machine Learning is the practice of applying algorithms and statistics to create models to create models that can learn from data and then make decisions or predictions about future data. Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations as it automates repetitive tasks, increases efficiency of processes, and mitigates human error which allows employees to focus on more critical or strategic decisions. <br/>

### Many organizations make use of Machine Learning (ML). Some examples include:
1. Image Recognition :camera:  <br/>
* ML can be used to recognizes objects in an image such as faces, abnormalities in health and medicine, image recognition in shopping, and even security and safety. In all of these cases, ML's algorithm lets it's user focus on solving the critical problems at hand such as a farmer intervening when ML notices that a plant has a new disease or a doctor is able to work on finding a solution when an imageing machine notices an abnormality from a previous image. <br/>
2. Predict Traffic Patterns :vertical_traffic_light:   <br/>
* ML can be used to help generate predictions regarding the fastest route to a destination. This is apparent in most GPS programs which take user information from multiple drivers to find the best route. <br/>
3. Fraud Detection :x:  <br/>
* ML can be utilized to analyze user behaviors and patterns which can in turn detect any number of anamolies. For example, if it detects multiple purchases in a short period of time or purchases from a completely different country/IP address, it can warn the user. <br/>
4. Chatbots/Customer Service :speech_balloon: <br/>
* ML can be leveraged to create a chatbot which answers any customer inquiries/problems and provide this support 24/7. This cuts on labour costs as well as creating an easier method for the customer to get help any time of the day. <br/>
5. Data Analysis/Data Entry :computer: <br/>
* ML can help automate the data input side and provide accurate insight and prediction to inform important decision making. Some markets that may use this are health, finance, and marketing. <br/>

## **Project Description**<br/> 
In this project, we are utilizing Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of someone having a stroke based on various health factors including hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, and bmi and social factors including if married, type of area they live in, and type of work. Although we are not able to accurately present the exact percentage of likelihood of getting a stroke, we are able to say whether one is more likely or less likely to get a stroke given the data.<br/>
